Ehal stands for Embedded Hardware Abstaction Layer, the goal of the project
is to create a simple to use hardware interfaces to the various
architectures and CPUs available in the market.
That will make possible to create a driver only once and reuse it in a
diferent project even with diferent processors. But for that...

Roadmap:
- Finish ARCH and MCU independent building process.
- Create the abstract interfaces for MCU peripherals.
- Installation to make the various toolchains find the libs and headers.
- Find peaple to help with the project.
- Create drivers with the unified API for common HW like:
displays, RTCs, etc.
- God knows....
