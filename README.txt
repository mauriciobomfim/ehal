Ehal stands for Embedded Hardware Abstaction Layer, the goal of the project
is to create a simple to use and most importantly common hardware interfaces
to the various architectures and CPUs available in the market.
That will make possible to create a driver only once and reuse it in a
diferent project, wich makes delivery time faster, and programmers happier.
That goes for hobbists to electronics engeniers.

Roadmap:
- Finish ARCH and MCU independent building process.
- Create the abstract interfaces for MCU peripherals.
- Installation to make the various toolchains find the libs and headers.
- Find peaple to help with the project
- Create Libs for commons hardware using these platform independent
interaces, like Displays, RTC...
