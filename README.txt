Ehal stands for Embedded Hardware Abstaction, the goal of the project is
to create a simple to use and most importantly common to various
architectures like AVR, ARM, PIC... and various CPUs libs for PIO, I2C, SPI,
after.

Roadmap:
- Finish ARCH and MCU independent building process.
- Create the abstac interface MCU peripherals.
- Installation to make the various toolchains find the libs and headers.
- Find peaple to help with the project
- Create Libs for commons hardware using these platform independent
interaces, like Displays, RTC...
