 * "THE VODKA-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42):
 * <mpolitzer.c@gmail.com> wrote this file. As long as you retain this
 * notice you can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some
 * day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a vodka in
 * return, Marcelo Politzer Couto
 *
 * If this licence resembles the BEER-WARE licence, thats not true,
 * it is more like an exact copy of it, but with a `sed s/BEER/VODKA/g' :D
 *
 * The small catch is that you can't use Projet or sub-part of it to 
 * military pourposes.
