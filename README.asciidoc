== Introduction ==

Ehal stands for Embedded Hardware Abstraction Layer, the goal of the project
is to create a simple to use hardware interfaces to the various
architectures and MCUs available in the market.

With that, it will be possible create a driver only once and reuse it in any
of the supported hardware by the ehal. This is second step and is getting
planed. The GeLip - Generic Library Project.

But before that we need to...

== Roadmap ==

- Finish ARCH and MCU independent building process.
- Create the abstract interfaces for MCU peripherals.
- Installation to make the various toolchains find the libs and headers.
- Find people to help with the project.
...

== Planned Architectures and MCUs ==
